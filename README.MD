<h1 align="center">ðŸŽ¯Student Spend Analysis</h1>

There are many stores in which a survey was conducted
based on students i.e.
how much they are spending on different kind of purchases
like Video games, Indoor games, Toys,
Books, Gadgets etc. In the data set (Student Survey), Store
setting is the column that explains the Type
of location in which the store is present. By using data set
(Student Survey), try to extract the
meaningful Insights.
Data set - Student survey
Problem Statement- Create a Power BI Report:
- Tabular Visualization - Format the total amount of
purchase (TAP) based on â€˜Store locationâ€™ and â€˜Store
settingâ€™: -
If 0<TAP<35000, then records should be in red color
If 35000<=TAP<60000, then records should be in yellow
color
If TAP>=60000, then records should be in Blue color

- Matrix Visualization â€“ Create Matrix Visualization to show
the amount spent on Outdoor sports across
different ages and â€˜Store settingâ€™. Do the color formatting for
the amount spent in total outdoor sports.

- Funnel chart â€“ Create a Funnel chart to show Total amount
of purchase by â€˜Store settingâ€™. Show the
data labels as Percentage of First.

- Pie chart â€“ Show the total amount of purchase by different
â€˜Store locationâ€™ for Suburban â€˜Store settingâ€™
only. Hint: Use Filter context

- a) Scatter plot - Video games purchase and Outdoor sports
spent across the different ages.

  b) Sand dance plot - Indoor sports and Video games spent
across the different age groups.

- Restrict data access for the given users in User mapping
table. For ex. Mani deals with Rural area only
so she should be able to view the data which belongs to Rural
only, not urban and suburban data.

- Publish the report on Power BI cloud service and Design
the Master Dashboard consisting of Funnel
chart and scatter plots. Then create a schedule refresh for six
times in every 4 hours for the Dashboard in
a day.

- Use Q&A feature of Power BI â€“
a) To show average age of students
b) Donut chart for total amount of purchases by â€˜Store
locationâ€™
